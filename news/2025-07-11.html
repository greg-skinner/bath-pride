In the mid-2010s, Bath had first a gay mayor and later a gay MP.

You needed enough people prepared to assemble and loudly celebrate and protest at a time of rising hatred and violence towards us.

Bath Pride was a family picnic in the grounds of the Holburne Museum, a club night at Komedia, and a thousand people marching through the streets to demand our liberation.</div><div class="_text_tf1c3_11" style="--grid-row:13">Bath Pride was about community. I have so much respect for how much the organisers centred this in everything they did. There were no corporate floats, no major brands, no prioritising of some queer people over others. Most of the people in the march were just ordinary individuals, out solo or with their partners or friends. There was also a significant presence from groups including a local church, the city&#x27;s roller derby league, and the LGBTQ+ staff group from the Royal United Hospital. My mum volunteered as a steward.</div><div class="_image_tf1c3_16" style="--grid-start:13;--grid-end:19"><div class="_content_61zs1_1" style="--grid-start:13;--grid-end:19"><img src="/news/happy-people.jpeg" alt="Photo of four happy people at Pride."/><label></label></div></div><div class="_text_tf1c3_11" style="--grid-row:14">Bath Pride was radical. It had never been done like this before, and it was done so well. While the overwhelming vibe was one of joy and celebration, this was very much a protest. Home-made placards abounded. NHS staff pointedly wore pro-trans t-shirts. A tall person with a stylish mustache wearing a cowboy hat, open pink cropped jacket and pink shorts waved a Palestinian flag in solidarity with the people of Gaza. This Pride was very Bath, but it was also about moving beyond tolerance, arguing for real liberation in a way that challenged the city&#x27;s cosy liberal consensus.</div><div class="_text_tf1c3_11" style="--grid-row:15">On some streets, people stood and waved or even joined in, with the march swelling as it went. On others, especially in busy shopping areas, I was reminded of the tension and threat inherent in <a aria-label="WE ARE REVOLTING: my first Trans Pride article on Ruth&#x27;s website" class="_link_c8z5n_1" href="https://ruthpearce.net/2018/03/31/we-are-revolting-my-first-trans-pride/#comments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Trans Pride</a>, with confused or hostile looks directed our way. We were challenging people: with loud disco music, with political slogans, with our insistent presence. In the context of Bath&#x27;s politely commercial street culture, even thoroughly overbaked chants such as “trans rights are human rights” took on a new resonance. At a time when the NHS, schools, and new Labour government are <a aria-label="Trans Kids Deserve Better and need your help right now article by Trans Writes" class="_link_c8z5n_1" href="https://transwrites.world/trans-kids-deserve-better/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">actively attacking</a> young trans people&#x27;s basic access to healthcare, education, and any level of personal autonomy, this kind of visibility couldn&#x27;t be more important.</div><div class="_text_tf1c3_11" style="--grid-row:16">After the march, my partner and I wandered the Holburne grounds. We admired stalls for local queer crafts, as well as community groups such as Bath Welcomes Refugees, The Diversity Trust, B&amp;NES Fostering, and… Off The Record. I took the time to thank the people on this stall for the support I received from their organisation 20 years ago, and learned about what they are doing to support young people today.</div><div class="_text_tf1c3_11" style="--grid-row:17">And then we left the city centre - walking up Gay&#x27;s Hill, before taking time for a drink and apple pie at the Fairfield Arms. The pub, which has been run by a gay couple for many years now, was full of local people enjoying a Sunday roast or just hanging out in the pub garden. We had a chat with one of the landlords, who said he was a bit sad to miss the Pride event, but the weekend was always a busy time for them.</div><div class="_text_tf1c3_11" style="--grid-row:18">Queer lives are weaved through the very fabric of the city of Bath. We are always and have always been everywhere, quietly getting on with our day to day. But we also deserve love, recognition, community, and visibility on our own terms. That&#x27;s why Pride is so important.</div></div></div><div class="_footer_dirw0_21 _footer_1giky_1"><div class="_spacer_1giky_25"></div><div class="_msg_1giky_13"><strong>Bath Pride</strong><div class="_links_1giky_10"><a aria-label="Our press kit" class="_link_c8z5n_1" href="/about-us/media" target="" rel="">Press kit</a> ⬩ <a aria-label="Our governance details" class="_link_c8z5n_1" href="/about-us/governance" target="" rel="">Governance</a> ⬩ <a aria-label="Acknowledgements" class="_link_c8z5n_1" href="/about-us/acknowledgements" target="" rel="">Acknowledgements</a> ⬩ <a aria-label="Send us an email" class="_link_c8z5n_1" href="mailto:hello@bathpride.org" target="" rel="">Contact</a></div><div class="_smaller_1giky_18">Registed charity number 1206748</div><div class="_smaller_1giky_18">©2025 <!-- -->790e773

I have so much respect for how much the organisers centred this in everything they did. There were no corporate floats, no major brands, no prioritising of some queer people over others. Most of the people in the march were just ordinary individuals, out solo or with their partners or friends. There was also a significant presence from groups including a local church, the city's roller derby league, and the LGBTQ+ staff group from the Royal United Hospital. My mum volunteered as a steward.","Bath Pride was radical. It had never been done like this before, and it was done so well. While the overwhelming vibe was one of joy and celebration, this was very much a protest. Home-made placards abounded. NHS staff pointedly wore pro-trans t-shirts. A tall person with a stylish mustache wearing a cowboy hat, open pink cropped jacket and pink shorts waved a Palestinian flag in solidarity with the people of Gaza. This Pride was very Bath, but it was also about moving beyond tolerance, arguing for real liberation in a way that challenged the city's cosy liberal consensus.","On some streets, people stood and waved or even joined in, with the march swelling as it went. On others, especially in busy shopping areas, I was reminded of the tension and threat inherent in = https://ruthpearce.net/2018/03/31/we-are-revolting-my-first-trans-pride/#comments = WE ARE REVOLTING: my first Trans Pride article on Ruth's website = Trans Pride =, with confused or hostile looks directed our way. We were challenging people: with loud disco music, with political slogans, with our insistent presence. In the context of Bath's politely commercial street culture, even thoroughly overbaked chants such as “trans rights are human rights” took on a new resonance. At a time when the NHS, schools, and new Labour government are = https://transwrites.world/trans-kids-deserve-better/ = Trans Kids Deserve Better and need your help right now article by Trans Writes = actively attacking = young trans people's basic access to healthcare, education, and any level of personal autonomy, this kind of visibility couldn't be more important.","After the march, my partner and I wandered the Holburne grounds. We admired stalls for local queer crafts, as well as community groups such as Bath Welcomes Refugees, The Diversity Trust, B&NES Fostering, and… Off The Record. I took the time to thank the people on this stall for the support I received from their organisation 20 years ago, and learned about what they are doing to support young people today.","And then we left the city centre - walking up Gay's Hill, before taking time for a drink and apple pie at the Fairfield Arms. The pub, which has been run by a gay couple for many years now, was full of local people enjoying a Sunday roast or just hanging out in the pub garden. We had a chat with one of the landlords, who said he was a bit sad to miss the Pride event, but the weekend was always a busy time for them.","Queer lives are weaved through the very fabric of the city of Bath. We are always and have always been everywhere, quietly getting on with our day to day. But we also deserve love, recognition, community, and visibility on our own terms. That's why Pride is so important."]}},"abortReason":"!undefined","_urlRewrite":null,"_urlRedirect":"!undefined","abortStatusCode":"!undefined","_abortCall":"!undefined","_pageContextInitHasClientData":"!undefined","_pageId":"/pages/news/@id"}</script>
