After a while I realised that label didn&#x27;t fit either, and I found out online there was a whole community who felt like they didn&#x27;t fit cleanly on either side of the gender spectrum, instead being a mix of both, neither, or something else entirely. making friends online and having people use my preferred name and pronouns made it click like, oh, this is who I am. It makes sense now. reading about the history of nonbinary and transmasc lesbians was also a huge part of learning about and accepting myself. I think it helps to know not only are you not alone, but people have been feeling this way long before you. you have a whole history you get to learn about and a whole future you get be a part of.</div><div class="_text_tf1c3_11" style="--grid-row:5">Supernova: I first realised I was non binary when I was 21. I didn&#x27;t even think gender could have a spectrum and I had never even questioned myself or my gender identity until I started seeing more people. Having visible people everyday who express themselves as who they feel they are and spread information about gender is the main reason that made me realise that I&#x27;m also non binary. It just took me years of not knowing nothing about it due to not having information at all until I realised through friends that this has been here for thousands of years. Also, one of the most important tools I&#x27;ve used to explore my gender identity, is drag. That helped a lot.</div><div class="_image_tf1c3_16" style="--grid-start:5;--grid-end:10"><div class="_content_1agpk_1" style="--grid-start:5;--grid-end:10"><img src="/news/local-drag-3.jpg" alt="Supernova&#x27;s publicity headshot picture"/><label></label></div></div><h3 class="_text_tf1c3_11" style="--grid-row:6">What are some of the biggest challenges you&#x27;ve faced as a nonbinary person?</h3><div class="_text_tf1c3_11" style="--grid-row:7">Diomede: Constant misgendering, having to explain or water down my identity to most people, being seen as “woman-lite” (this one SUCKS!)</div><div class="_text_tf1c3_11" style="--grid-row:8">Supernova: Once I realised I was non binary (and very proud of it) I started expressing myself in a different way. I had always been perceived as a man. But I knew I was not. And at the same time I do enjoy masculinity, but not the idea of masculinity that the system has. So I tried to figure out who I was through clothes and makeup and started deconstructing myself to build up a new masculinity/femininity that could match what I was feeling and could make me feel comfortable. And doing that in public was also a bit scary at first due to the traditional views on gender we&#x27;ve had growing up.</div><h3 class="_text_tf1c3_11" style="--grid-row:9">Can you share any significant triumphs or moments of joy related to your nonbinary identity?</h3><div class="_text_tf1c3_11" style="--grid-row:10">Diomede: Doing drag has been massive. Having this character that at its core is both nonbinary and genderqueer, and then having them be celebrated and accepted so completely has been a huge source of joy over the past year.</div><div class="_image_tf1c3_16" style="--grid-start:10;--grid-end:14"><div class="_content_1agpk_1" style="--grid-start:10;--grid-end:14"><img src="/news/local-drag-2.jpg" alt="Diomede&#x27;s publicity headshot picture"/><label></label></div></div><div class="_text_tf1c3_11" style="--grid-row:11">Supernova: Having more nonbinary people around me has definitely made me feel so much better about how I feel with myself.

What matters to me most is actual nonbinary people playing nonbinary characters, and actual nonbinary people being themselves. That authenticity will always be by far the most meaningful. eg: watching Jonathan Van Ness come out over the course of Queer Eye was genuinely really affirming for me! Or Mae Martin in season 2 of Feel Good - messy, realistic representation. Good stuff.</div><div class="_text_tf1c3_11" style="--grid-row:14">Supernova: [it&#x27;s] As important as having cis people. We need to be on the same level to be equal. I think we&#x27;re quite visible nowadays compared to a few years back but still, we need more visibility in everyday situations. As a community we tend to meet in queer spaces which is great and also social media has helped a lot, but representation is important for people who don&#x27;t know much about gender expression or identity, or haven&#x27;t really questioned things yet. Having information there, open to anyone is something that can really help yourself discover what you need.</div><div class="_image_tf1c3_16" style="--grid-start:14;--grid-end:18"><div class="_content_1agpk_1" style="--grid-start:14;--grid-end:18"><img src="/news/local-drag-5.jpg" alt="Supernova striking a pose on stage"/><label></label></div></div><h3 class="_text_tf1c3_11" style="--grid-row:15">What changes do you think would make everyday life easier for nonbinary individuals?</h3><div class="_text_tf1c3_11" style="--grid-row:16">Diomede: Let&#x27;s just all start introducing our pronouns when we meet people.
