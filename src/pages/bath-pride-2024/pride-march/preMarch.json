  "# Getting there from the picnic",
  "Please be aware that the picnic is a short distance from the start of the march so you will need to leave some time to get there for the assembly time. We found that it takes about 7 minutes, including waiting to cross the road in several places. Please note that this is not a part of the march route, and you should exercise normal caution around the roads and crossings. See the carousel below for details on how to get to the route start from the picnic location."
