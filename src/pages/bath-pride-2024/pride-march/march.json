  "Pride is a protest. Marches are an important part of pride, they provide an opportunity for the LGBT+ community to come together to further our rights, and try to create a more tolerant and accepting city. We are working with our partners to finalise the route and we hope you will be able to join us.",
  "# How to March ",
  "For this march, we are inviting groups to book spaces to be involved with the procession. If you are an individual who wishes to be involved you can sign up to be a volunteer, or we would encourage any individual to create a campaign group with others and apply. Although we will try and accommodate as many groups as possible, preference will be given to the groups that are: * Local to Bath, or have a significant presence in the city * Focused on LGBT+ experience, or in some way include LGBT+ people * Campaigning, such as groups working on furthering the rights of LGBT+ people or actively working to make Bath, the local area, or nationally, a better place * Align with our values, which are Affirming, Transparent, Justice, Grassroots, Vibrant, and Safe * Trans inclusive, actively welcomes and supports trans people * ",
