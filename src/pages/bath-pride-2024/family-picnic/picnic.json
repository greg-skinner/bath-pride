  "During Bath Pride we are holding a family picnic in the grounds of the Holburne Museum. We will be hosting local musicians to serenade you and charities and other organisations will be there so you can find out what they do and how you can help further LGBT+ rights in Bath.",
  "# What's on offer",
  "We are still in the process of finalising some of the details to bring you a magical first Bath Pride. What we can say is that we will be having a family picnic in the grounds, so remember to bring your food and drinks with you, to relax and sit alongside the Bath Pride family. There is a cafe within the Holburne Museum if you are feeling peckish. ",
  "We will also have some local musicians that will be playing some music. We are so looking forward to announcing them in the run up to the event so keep an eye on our socials! ",
